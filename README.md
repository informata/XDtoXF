# Adobe XD to Xamarin.Forms exporter

Adobe XD Plugin to export assets to Xamarin.Forms XAML Styles and Resources. Created by [kphillpotts](https://github.com/kphillpotts/XDtoXF).

## Demo

1. Select `Plugins -> Xamarin.Forms Exporter`
2. A preview will open displaying the XAML resources.  You can either just select and copy some of the resources from the preview, or go ahead and hit `Copy` to copy all the resources to your clipboard
3. Paste into your resource dictionary in a XAML file
